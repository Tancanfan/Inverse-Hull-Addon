#### Inverse Hull Outline Addon
## Description:
The Inverse Hull Outline addon for Blender automatically adds a cartoon-style outline to selected 3D meshes, giving them a stylized, cel-shaded appearance. This can be particularly useful for creating 3D models with a hand-drawn or comic book-like aesthetic.

## What is an Inverse Hull?
An inverse hull is a technique used to generate outlines around 3D objects by duplicating and scaling the mesh slightly outward, then inverting the normals. This process creates a visible outline that simulates the look of traditional cartoon-style drawing.
